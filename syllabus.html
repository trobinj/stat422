422)</h1>
<h3 class="subtitle">Johnson, Fall 2024</h3>

</div>


<p>You can also download a <a href="syllabus.pdf">PDF</a> copy of this
syllabus.</p>
<p><strong>Instructor</strong>: Dr. Timothy R. Johnson, Professor of
Statistics, Department of Mathematics and Statistical Science. Email: <a
href="mailto:trjohns@uidaho.edu" class="email">trjohns@uidaho.edu</a>.
Office phone: 208-885-2928. Department phone: 208-885-6742. My office is
<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/zcpTXzbPCGWGj7tM9">Brink 417</a>. Office
hours are by appointment, but you are welcome to drop-in without an
appointment. I can meet in person or over Zoom.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong>: The primary learning outcome for
this course is a familiarity with design and inference for complex
sampling designs. This includes but is not limited to simple,
stratified, and cluster probability sampling designs, sample size
selection and allocation, ratio and regression estimators, domain
estimation, post-stratification, unequal probability sampling, double
sampling, weighting and calibration, the use of auxiliary variables in
sampling designs and estimation, and abundance estimation. The focus is
largely on design-based methods, although model-based and model-assisted
methods may also be discussed. Students will also be introduced to
software procedures for implementing some of the sampling designs and
statistical analyses discussed.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Stat 251 or Stat 301 with a grade of
‘C’ or better.</p>
<p><strong>Textbook</strong>: There is no textbook for this course.
Lecture (notes) will be your primary source.</p>
<p><strong>Software</strong>: I will be using <a
href="https://www.r-project.org">R</a> with <a
href="https://www.rstudio.com">RStudio</a> for some demonstrations. Both
software packages are free and available for download for a variety of
operating systems. Prior experience with R and RStudio is not
assumed.</p>
<p><strong>Course Website</strong>: Many course materials including
lecture notes, homework assignments, study guides, this syllabus, and
other materials can be found at <a
href="https://trobinj.github.io/stat422">trobinj.github.io/stat422</a>.
Note that this is separate from <a
href="http://canvas.uidaho.edu">Canvas</a>, which will only be used for
examination scores. Canvas does have a link to the course website.</p>
<p><strong>Homework</strong>: Homework assignments be made available
periodically on the <a href="https://trobinj.github.io/stat422">course
website</a> (see the <a
href="https://trobinj.github.io/stat422/lectures">lectures</a> section).
Homework assignments will not be collected or graded. Some computational
problems in the examinations are based on homework problems (although
the numbers may be changed in some cases) so it is highly recommended
that you have worked through the homework problems before each
examination and have your solutions handy as well as an understanding of
how to arrive at those solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Examinations</strong>: There are four examinations. The first
three examinations will be administered on 9/20, 10/21, and 11/22 during
the normal lecture time. These dates may be postponed if unforeseen
circumstances delay progression through the material in lecture. A
fourth comprehensive final examination will be administered during the
final examination time of Friday, December 13, from 12:45 to 2:45. The
fourth and final examination may not be taken at another time unless, as
according to university policy, you have more than two final
examinations on that day, or a conflict with a documented university
sanctioned event. Notice of a missed examination due to a foreseeable
absence must be given <em>at least one week before</em> the scheduled
day of the examination. Notice of a missed examination due to
unforeseeable absence must be made <em>before the end of the day</em>
for which the examination was scheduled. If I contact you to schedule a
make-up a examination you must respond <em>promptly</em> (i.e., the same
day) or you may not be able to make up the examination. You will have
the full class session (50 minutes) for the first three examinations,
and two hours for the fourth examination. The format of the examinations
will be a mixture of short answer and multiple choice questions. Study
guides will be provided for each examination in the <a
href="https://trobinj.github.io/stat422/lectures">lectures</a> section
of the course website. The examinations are open-notes (print only, no
computer access will be allowed during the examinations), and a
calculator is recommended. Note that while the examinations are
open-notes, you should not count on having enough time to look
everything up so be sure to be adequately prepared for the examinations.
<strong>Please note that the third examination is on the Friday before
fall recess, and the final examination is on the Friday of the week of
finals so plan accordingly</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Grading</strong>: Your grade in this course is based on the
four examinations. Each examination is weighted equally regardless of
the number of points on the examination. Final grades will be assigned
according to the following rubric: A (87.5%-100%), B (75%-87.5%), C
(62.5%-75%), D (50%-62.5%), F (less than 50%). Any changes to this
grading system will not result in lower scores/grades for any
students.</p>
<p><strong>Statistics Assistance Center</strong>: Please <strong>do
not</strong> request assistance from the <a
href="https://www.uidaho.edu/sci/stat/about/sac">Statistics Assistance
Center (SAC)</a> for this course. The SAC is <strong>not</strong>
designed or funded to support Stat 422.</p>
<p><strong>Academic Honesty</strong>: You are responsible for being
aware of the policies of the University of Idaho on academic honesty.
See Section A-1 of Article II of the <a
href="http://www.uidaho.edu/student-affairs/dean-of-students/student-conduct/student-code-of-conduct">Student
Code of Conduct</a>. This includes but is not limited to cheating,
facilitation of cheating, and furnishing false information or false
representation. Breaches of academic honesty will not be tolerated, and
will result in a F for the course and referral to the Dean of Students
for further disciplinary action.</p>
<p><strong>Disability Access and Resources</strong>: University of Idaho
is committed to ensuring an accessible learning environment where course
or instructional content are usable by all students and faculty. If you
believe that you require disability-related academic adjustments for
this class (including pregnancy-related disabilities), please contact
Center for Disability Access and Resources (CDAR) to discuss
eligibility. A current accommodation letter from CDAR is required before
any modifications, above and beyond what is otherwise available for all
other students in this class will be provided. Please be advised that
disability-related academic adjustments are not retroactive. CDAR is
located at the Bruce Pitman Building, Suite 127. Phone is 208-885-6307
and e-mail is <a href="mailto:cdar@uidaho.edu"
class="email">cdar@uidaho.edu</a>. For a complete listing of services
and current business hours visit <a

<p><strong>Title IX</strong>: University of Idaho is committed to
creating a safe learning environment for all students. Consistent with
this, UI policy and Title IX prohibit sexual misconduct, which includes
sex or gender based harassment, sexual assault, intimate partner
violence, stalking, and retaliation. If you have experienced any form of
sexual misconduct, know that help and support are available. Please be
aware that all University of Idaho employees are mandatory reporters and
are required to report any information they receive about sexual
misconduct to the university’s Title IX Coordinator within 24 hours
(Idaho State Board Policy, Section I, I.T.). Visit <a

are confidential. If you would like to report an incident, you may do so
anonymously by visiting <a
href="https://www.uidaho.edu/vandalcare">www.uidaho.edu/vandalcare</a>
or you can directly contact the Office of Civil Rights and
Investigations at 208-885-4285 or <a href="mailto:ocri@uidaho.edu"
