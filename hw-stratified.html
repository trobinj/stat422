<h2>Estimation and Allocation</h2>
Educational psychologists wanted to know the mean performance on a
cognitive test for the 1000 students at a school. The test is expensive
and time-consuming and so it was decided to administer the test to only
a sample of students and to use these data to estimate the mean test
score for all students at the school. A sample of 200 students was
selected using stratified random sampling. The strata were defined by
classifying the students as high-, medium-, or low-achieving students
based on other test scores that were on record for all students at the
school. The 200 sampled students were given administered the cognitive
test. The table below shows the number of students in each stratum, the
number of students sampled from each stratum, and the mean and standard
deviation of the test scores of the students that were sampled from each
stratum.

<p>Use this information to answer the following questions.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Confirm that the estimate of the mean test score for all of the
students at the school is 69, that the estimate of the variance of the
estimator used to obtain this estimate is approximately 0.84, that the
standard error is approximately 0.92, that the bound on the error of
estimation is approximately 1.83, and so the confidence interval for the
mean test score for all students at the school is approximately 69 <span
class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> 1.83.</p></li>
<li><p>The survey described above was conducted several years ago. The
educational psychologists are planning a new survey this year. The
composition of the school has changed slightly. The school has grown to
a total of 1300 students. Of these, 400 are classified as
high-achieving, 600 are classified as medium-achieving, and 300 are
classified as low-achieving students. Assume that it costs $20 to test
one student, regardless of their achievement level. Confirm that the
optimum allocation for a fixed bound on the error of estimation of one
point (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> = 1) would be to
sample approximately 106 high-achieving students, approximately 238
medium-achieving students, and approximately 159 low-achieving
students.</p></li>
<li><p>It was determined that the allocation found in the previous
problem was too expensive. In addition to a cost of $20 per tested
student, there is an overhead cost of $2000 for the specialists
administering the test. Confirm that the optimum allocation for a fixed
total cost of $10000 would be to sample approximately 84 high-achieving
students, approximately 189 medium-achieving students, and approximately
126 low-achieving students.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Forestry researchers conducted a survey to estimate the number of
trees of a particular species in a region of forest. They used a
stratified random sampling design. The region had been divided into 500
units, each with an area of one hectare. Each unit had also been
classified as either “low-elevation” or “high-elevation” based on the
average elevation within each unit. A total of 400 units were classified
as low-elevation, and 100 units were classified as high-elevation. The
researchers selected 50 low-elevation units using simple random
sampling, and sent teams out to count the number of trees in each
sampled unit. The average number of trees per sampled low-elevation unit
was 100 trees, and the standard deviation was 10 trees. The researchers
also selected 50 high-elevation units using simple random sampling, and
sent teams out to count the number of trees in each of these sampled
units. The average number of trees per sampled high-elevation unit was
25 trees, and the standard deviation was 5 trees.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Confirm that the estimate of the total number of trees in the
region is 42500 trees, that the estimate of the variance of the
estimator used to obtain this estimate is 282500, that the standard
error is approximately 532 trees, that the bound on the error of
estimation is approximately 1063 trees, and that the confidence interval
for the total number of trees in the region is approximately 42500 <span
class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> 1063 trees.</p></li>
<li><p>The forestry researchers are planning another survey in a similar
forest region using stratified random sampling. This region has a total
of 1000 one-hectare units, of which 300 are low-elevation and 700 are
high-elevation. They estimate that the cost to survey a low-elevation
unit is $20 and the cost to survey a high-elevation unit is $10
(high-elevation units are cheaper despite being less accessible because
they tend to be more sparse with respect to flora and so faster to
survey). Confirm that the optimum allocation for a fixed bound on the
error of estimation of 1000 trees is to sample approximately 55
low-elevation units and approximately 91 high-elevation units.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider the previous problem where the forestry researchers are
planning a new survey. Assume that the researchers can spend $5000 on
the survey, but they only need to pay for surveying the units so there
is no overhead cost (any overhead cost will be paid for out of a
separate budget). Confirm that the optimum allocation for a fixed total
cost of $5000 is to sample approximately 137 low-elevation units and
approximately 226 high-elevation units.</p></li>

<h2>Design Effect and Effective Sample Size</h2>
<p>Consider the problem of estimating the parameter <span
class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> using one of three designs: simple
random sampling, stratified random sampling, and cluster sampling (which
we will talk about later in the course). Each are based on a total
sample size of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> = 1000 elements.
Assume we can compute (or at least estimate) the variance of the
estimator of <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> for each of the
three designs. The variances of the estimator under simple random
sampling, stratified random sampling, and cluster sampling are <span
class="math inline">\(V_{\tiny\mbox{srs}}(\hat\mu)\)</span> = 10, <span
class="math inline">\(V_{\tiny\mbox{strat}}(\hat\mu)\)</span> = 8, and
<span class="math inline">\(V_{\tiny\mbox{clus}}(\hat\mu)\)</span> = 16,
respectively. The stratified and cluster sampling designs are the
<em>complex</em> sampling designs. Confirm that the <em>design
effects</em> of the stratified and cluster sampling designs are 0.8 and
1.6, respectively. Also confirm that the <em>effective sample sizes</em>
of the stratified and cluster sampling designs are 1250 and 625,
respectively.</p>
</div>
<div id="double-sampling" class="section level2">
<h2>Double Sampling</h2>
Consider the previous example where educational psychologists wanted to
know the mean performance on a cognitive test for the 1000 students at a
school. In that example they had used the students’ scores on other
tests to stratify them into high-, medium-, and low-achieving students.
To avoid confusion such a test will be referred to as the
<em>stratifying test</em> as opposed to the <em>cognitive test</em>
which is the focus of the survey. But now suppose that the educational
psychologists did not have the scores on a stratifying test. This might
be because they had not taken such a test, or because the students had
taken such a test but the scores were not easily obtainable because they
were in separate files and so would require excessive effort to obtain
for all students at the school. So the researchers use a double sampling
design. In the first phase of sampling a sample of 500 students was
selected using simple random sampling. Stratifying test scores were then
obtained for these students (either by testing these students or by
going through their files) to classify them as high-, medium-, and
low-achieving students. In that sample 145 students were classified as
high-achieving, 246 were classified as medium-achieving, and 109 were
classified as low-achieving. Then a stratified random sampling design
was applied to the sample of 500 students, using approximate
proportional allocation. The results of this survey are summarized in
the table below.

<p>Confirm that the estimate of the mean score on the cognitive test of
all students at the school is approximately 70.</p>
<p>Consider the previous example were forestry researchers were
conducting a survey to estimate the number of trees of a particular
species in a region of forest divided into a total of 500 units. Recall
that they used elevation to stratify the units of forest. Now suppose
that the elevation data were not available, so the researchers used a
double sampling design to observe the elevation data in the field. First
a simple random sample of 100 units was selected and field crews were
sent to each unit to quickly inspect it and classify it as low-elevation
or high-elevation. They classified 77 units as low-elevation and 23 as
high-elevation. They then obtained a stratified random sample of these
sampled units by obtaining a simple random sample of 40 of the
low-elevation units, and a simple random sample of 20 of the
high-elevation units. For these 60 sampled units field crews counted the
number of trees. The mean number of trees per unit was 96 trees in the
low-elevation units, and 28 trees in the high-elevation units. Confirm
that the estimate of the total number of trees in the region is then
40180 trees.</p>
